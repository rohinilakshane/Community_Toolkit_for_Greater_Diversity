# Community_Toolkit_for_Greater_Diversity
This project contains learning modules from "Community Toolkit for Greater Diversity", (CTGD) a project for developing reference material related to diversty and inclusion for volunteers in open knowledge movements. This material is India-centric currently but we hope that it will be adopted by people living in other contexts and communities.

CTGD was funded by a project grant of the Wikimedia Foundation in 2017. Full documentation and learning modules at https://wikiinclusivity.in

All content in learning modules is licensed CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 International (Creative Commons-Attribution-Non-Commercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International) unless specified otherwise. The respective author(s) of the modules own the copyright. 

Eleven modules were developed as a part of the project. The modules are uploaded here for the benefit of those who would like to: 
a) translate them from English to other languages
b) use them as training material in their outreach or training events.
c) adopt, modify or build upon them. 

All modules are uploaded as PDFs. If you would like to request a copy in another file format or request a license waiver, please email the project team: wikiinclusivity@protonmail.com
